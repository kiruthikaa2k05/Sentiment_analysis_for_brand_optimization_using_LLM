# Sentiment Analysis for Brand Optimization using LLM

## 📌 Project Overview
This project leverages transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) such as BERT or RoBERTa for advanced sentiment analysis on customer reviews. Unlike traditional rule-based or classical ML methods, this model captures the context and semantics of user feedback to deliver high-accuracy sentiment classification, aiding brands in understanding customer perception and improving strategies.

## 🎯 Key Features
- Uses pre-trained transformer models (BERT/RoBERTa) for sentiment analysis
- Handles large volumes of unstructured review data
- Visualizes sentiment trends via word clouds, pie charts, and bar graphs
- Enables brand reputation scoring and decision support

## 📊 Technologies Used
- Python
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit (for optional web dashboard)
